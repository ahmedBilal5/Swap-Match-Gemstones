# Swap-Match-Gemstones
This is a swap and match game similar to Candy Crush with the major exception of having gemstones instead of candies. I coded this game in C++ using an object-oriented style.
Here are some directions to play and some general information about the game:
1)Use the mouse to click on a gem.
2)If the gem you clicked on forms a chain in an adjacent row or column, it will shift automatically to form a chain.
3)As soon as a chain is formed, it will be replaced with new random gems.
4)You will recieve points for each chain formed. Bigger the chains formed, higher the points.
5)clear the points threshold to move to the next level.
